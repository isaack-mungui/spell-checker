Automated Spell Checker
==============================

## Description
Automated spell checkers are used to analyze documents and locate words that might be misspelled. Theseprograms work by comparing each word in the document to a large dictionary(in the non-programming sense) of words. If the word is not found in the dictionary, it is flagged as potentially incorrect.
